    <p>After graduating from the University of Alabama, I moved to New Zealand, where I began working in the wine industry. My goal at the time was to continue traveling, and I found that the seasonal nature of winemaking allowed me to do that. For four years, I alternated between wine regions in the northern and southern hemispheres to catch the harvest season. This involved working on small teams to monitor and make precise adjustments to wine fermentations. The work was largely physical, and often entailed 80-hour weeks. I really enjoyed this lifestyle for the time, but eventually, I was ready to settle in one place.
    <p>I moved to Seattle in 2016, and began working on the winemaking team at House of Smith. As a lab assistant, I performed lab analysis and created spreadsheets to track daily lab results and wine additions. However, outide of the excitment of traveling, the wine industry wasn't appealing to me as a career path.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I'm studying software development at Code Fellows, and I'm excited to dive into the tech industry. Being a developer fits perfectly into my interests and skill set: I enjoy anything that involves logical problem-solving, and I also have an eye for making things look nice. I don't have a particular company in mind that I would like to work for, but I'm keeping my options open to see where my interests and talents land me.</p>
