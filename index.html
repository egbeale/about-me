    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>I've lived in Seattle for almost 6 years now, but I'm originally from Montgomery, Alabama. I studied Biology and Spanish at the University of Alabama. After graduating, I moved to New Zealand for a year, where I started working in the wine industry. I wanted to keep traveling, and realized that I could do so by working as a seasonal intern in wine cellars, alternating between the northern and southern hemispheres. I did this for about four years until I moved to Seattle in 2016.
    <p>In Seattle, I worked on the winemaking team at House of Smith. As a lab assistant, I monitored wine fermentations and created spreadsheets to track daily lab results. However, I realized I was never going to be passionate about the nuances of wine, and so I decided to switch directions.</p> 
    <p>I'm currently studying software development at Code Fellows. I'm excited about entering the tech industry. I think that being a developer fits perfectly into my interests and skill set: I enjoy anything that involves logical problem-solving, and I also have an eye for making things look nice. I don't have a particular company in mind that I would like to work for, but I'm keeping my options open to see where my talents will land.</p>
